                        I am a graphic and web designer and photographer who loves making things and coming up with new ideas. I grew up in Portland, Oregon. I went to Benson high school and am now majoring in design at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington.  I know HTML, CSS, Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere, and InDesign.<br>
                        <br>
                        I love street photography and taking photos of people in general. I started taking photos when I was 11 years old and continued doing it as a hobby. I became truly interested in high school and worked all summer for my first good camera. I got a sony A7 which became my workhorse camera for years. Only a couple years ago I bought a better camera, the Canon 1DX mark 1. I now use that much more than my 1dx although I still have it.<br>

                        I currently work at ResTek, the WWU housing website department. I work as a web designer and mainly update the site with new information. I also do some amount of photo and video for the site
